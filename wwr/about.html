            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Wisdom Rafting Company launched its website in 2026 as a way to showcase our
                thrilling rafting
                adventures and make it easier for customers to book trips online. The first version
                was simple,
                featuring basic information about our rafting packages, safety guidelines, and
                contact details. Over
                time, the website has evolved to include more interactive features, such as online
                reservations, customer reviews, photo galleries, and blog posts about river
                experiences. This
                digital presence has helped the company reach a wider audience, improve customer
                engagement, and provide up-to-date information about rafting conditions and events.
                Today, our website continues to serve as a hub for adventure seekers looking to
                experience safe and exciting river rafting.</p>
