        <p>Hello, my name is Wisdom Udeozor, I'm from Anambra state, NIgeria. I am a Software
            Development student at
            BYU–Idaho, building a strong foundation in
            programming,
            problem-solving, and analytical thinking. I am disciplined, goal-oriented, and committed
            to
            long-term growth both academically and professionally.

            I approach learning with consistency and intentionality, valuing clear structure, focus,
            and
            continuous improvement. Beyond technical skills, I place strong emphasis on personal
            development,
            resilience, and healthy routines, believing that clarity of mind and discipline are
            essential to
            performing at a high level.

            I am motivated by challenges that require patience, logical reasoning, and steady skill
            development.
            My goal is to grow into a reliable and adaptable software developer who contributes
            meaningfully to
            teams and projects while continuing to learn and improve over time.</p>
